**It’s an easy story for me to tell. When I was 10 there was nothing more exciting to me than playing around with the old broken computers my dad, who worked in tech, would give me. I became a teenage game modder and hobby web developer. After college I worked at a non-profit, not making much, when I was offered an exciting position as a web developer where I made 5x as much. I’ve been doing it ever since. It’s a story people who hire me or who promote the tech industry love to hear. But it’s not the whole story.**

对我来说，这是一个简单的故事。 在我10岁的时候，没有什么比摆弄我在科技行业工作的父亲给我的破旧电脑更让我兴奋的了。 我成为了一个青少年游戏模型制作者和爱好网页开发者。 大学毕业后，我在一家非盈利机构工作，收入不多，当时我得到了一个令人兴奋的职位——网页开发员，我的收入是他们的5倍。 从那以后我就一直这么做。 这是那些雇佣我的人或是那些推动科技产业发展的人喜欢听到的故事。 但这并不是全部。

**Passion is prized in this industry and people who come into code out of love are considered special. [It is also considered the reason why certain groups of people are less represented in tech, because not as many of them are building Linux machines in their basements for fun.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-08-09/as-a-woman-in-tech-i-realized-these-are-not-my-people)**

在这个行业里，激情是被珍视的，出于爱而进入编码领域的人被认为是特殊的。 这也被认为是某些人群在科技领域缺乏代表性的原因，因为他们中的很多人并不是为了好玩而在地下室里构建 Linux 机器。

**But the problem with that is that hobby coding isn’t at all like coding for work. Very few coding jobs allow you to do the kind of work that hobby coders enjoy. I think in many ways the industry is becoming a lot like the programming portrayed in Snow Crash, which was written in 1992 but reads as almost an oracle:**

但这样做的问题在于，业余编程与工作编程完全不同。 很少有编程工作能让你做爱好编程的人喜欢的工作。 我认为，在许多方面，这个行业正在变得非常像《雪崩》(Snow Crash)中描述的那样。《雪崩》写于1992年，但读起来几乎像是一个预言:

> **She is an applications programmer for the Feds. In the old days, she would have written computer programs for a living. Nowadays, she writes fragments of computer programs. These programs are designed by Marietta and Marietta’s superiors in massive week-long meetings on the top floor. Once they get the design down, they start breaking up the problem into tinier and tinier segments, assigning them to group managers, who break them down even more and feed little bits of work to the individual programmers. In order to keep the work done by the individual coders from colliding, it all has to be done according to a set of rules and regulations even bigger and more fluid than the Government procedure manual.**
>
> 她是联邦调查局的应用程序员。 在过去，她以编写计算机程序为生。 现在，她写一些计算机程序的片段。 这些方案是由玛丽埃塔和玛丽埃塔的上司在顶楼举行的为期一周的大型会议上设计的。 一旦他们完成了设计，他们就开始把问题分解成更小更细的部分，分配给各组经理，然后再分解成更细的部分，再把一小部分工作交给各个程序员。 为了防止个人程序员所做的工作发生冲突，所有这些工作都必须根据一套比政府程序手册更大、更灵活的规则和条例来完成。

**There are certainly more engaging jobs out there, but the reality is a lot of us do work on little fragments, work that is often tedious and devoid of any kind of creativity. As a developer I’ve often had trouble figuring out if a job would be Snow Crashy or not, and been seduced by promises of engaging work only to find myself ferreting out bugs on some enterprise CMS.**

当然还有更吸引人的工作，但现实是我们中的很多人都在做一些零碎的工作，这些工作通常很乏味，缺乏任何形式的创造力。 作为一个开发人员，我经常搞不清楚一个工作是不是 Snow Crashy，并且为了发现自己在一些企业内容管理系统上发现的漏洞而被工作的承诺所吸引。

**But for a long time I pretended it was fun. That I loved it. Because there is a lot of social pressure to portray yourself that way in the industry. People hiring you will run the other way as soon as they see a crack in that facade.**

但是很长一段时间我都假装这很有趣。 我很喜欢。 因为有很多社会压力要求你在这个行业中以这种方式表现自己。 雇佣你的人一旦看到你表面上的缺陷，他们就会反其道而行之。

**Wanna here the real story of how I became a professional developer? I actually was a freelancer after working at that non-profit, I took the developer job because the medical bills piled up. And stayed because they never went away.**

想知道我是如何成为一名专业开发人员的真实故事吗？ 在那家非盈利机构工作之后，我其实是个自由职业者，我接受了开发者的工作，因为医疗账单堆积如山。 留下来是因为他们永远不会离开。

**It’s hard for me to admit, I know it’s hard for a lot of people. I know there are others working as developers for the health insurance or to support their families. Even James Damore, who became infamous for his claim women are less represented in tech because we are less interested in it, admits as much in a CNN interview:**

这对我来说很难承认，我知道这对很多人来说很难。 我知道还有其他一些人为了健康保险或者养家糊口而从事开发工作。 甚至詹姆斯 · 达莫尔也在接受 CNN 采访时承认:

> **part of the reason so many men go into tech is because it’s high paying, I know of many people in Google who weren’t necessarily passionate about it but it would provide for their family and so they still worked there**
>
> 我知道很多在谷歌工作的人并不一定对科技充满热情，但是它能养活他们的家庭，所以他们仍然在那里工作

**If I won the lottery would I still code? I would, but it would not be like work. It would be projects I enjoyed. And it would be fewer hours.**

如果我中了彩票，我还会写代码吗？ 我会的，但不会像工作一样。 这将是我喜欢的项目。 而且时间也会减少。

**Coding for a couple of hours a day in your spare time isn’t the same as coding for 8+ hours a day. Over the past decade it has worn me down. I have regular painful migraines triggered by working long hours. I have the beginnings of arthritis in my neck. I’ve tried standing desks, balance board desks, treadmill desks, special diets, exercising more before and after work. Doctors, physical therapists, massage therapists of every stripe. I’ve spent thousands and thousands of dollars. I’ve hidden it because I was afraid it would make me unemployable. I’ve worked those long hours in intense pain. I’m not sure desk jockeying for these kind of hours is good for anyone, it certainly wasn’t good for me.**

每天在业余时间花几个小时编码和每天花8个小时编码是不一样的。 在过去的十年里，它让我精疲力尽。 由于长时间工作，我经常患有疼痛的偏头痛。 我的脖子开始有关节炎。 我试过站立式办公桌，平衡板办公桌，跑步机办公桌，特殊饮食，工作前后多锻炼。 医生，物理治疗师，各种各样的按摩治疗师。 我已经花了成千上万的美元。 我把它藏起来是因为我怕它会让我找不到工作。 我在剧烈的疼痛中工作了很长时间。 我不确定这样的办公时间对任何人都有好处，当然对我也没有好处。

**I also have to say that there is a [toll](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/technology/silicon-valley-men-backlash-gender-scandals.html) to the constant backlash against women in tech. That what James Damore said that really cut to the core was that a lot of us women in tech were only there because a bar was lowered to get us in to meet some quota. And reading the reaction to it on websites I frequented and from people I once counted as friends was very hard. I can’t pretend this didn’t contribute to being demoralized. On the other side I am really sick of diversity programs I encountered that are corporate cheerleading and totally unwilling to do the hard work it would actually take to make this a better industry for women.**

我还必须说，在科技领域对女性的持续抵制是有代价的。 詹姆斯 · 达莫尔所说的真正切中要害的是，我们这些从事科技行业的女性之所以能够留在那里，只是因为为了达到某些配额而降低了一个门槛。 在我经常光顾的网站和我曾经视为朋友的人那里，读到他们对此的反应是非常困难的。 我不能假装这没有导致士气低落。 另一方面，我真的对我遇到的多元化项目感到厌烦，这些项目是企业的拉拉队，而且完全不愿意付出实际上需要付出的努力，让这个行业更适合女性。

**It’s really hard to celebrate “women’s day” with free feminist speakers when I just found out some guy who does the same work as me is getting paid 20% more. Also once in a while some jerk will be like “if women really were paid less why wouldn’t companies hire more women to save money?” I’m pretty sure they already do this and that recent lawsuits will reveal it is a [common practice](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/14/google-women-promotions-lower-paying-jobs-lawsuit). My experience is companies are thrilled to hire women, it makes them look good AND they can usually pay them less. It’s not about quotas.**

当我发现一个和我做同样工作的人可以多拿20% 的工资时，和那些免费的女权主义者一起庆祝“妇女节”真的很难。 还有一些混蛋会说“如果女性的薪水真的少了，为什么公司不雇佣更多的女性来省钱呢? ” 我相当肯定他们已经这样做了，而且最近的诉讼将揭示这是一种常见的做法。 我的经验是，公司对雇佣女性感到兴奋，这让她们看起来不错，而且通常可以给她们更少的报酬。 这与配额无关。

**Commenters on my previous article asked me why I didn’t just get my skills up to snuff and get “better” jobs. I’ve never really had trouble with that. I take to new technology easily and learn fast. I suspect I’ll keep doing that. But at this point I’ve lost all desire to try to hack it in the industry.**

上一篇文章的评论者问我，为什么我不把自己的技能提高到标准，然后找一份“更好”的工作。 我从来没有遇到过这样的问题。 我很容易适应新技术，而且学得很快。 我想我会继续这样做。 但在这一点上，我已经失去了所有的愿望，试图在这个行业中破解它。

**Because it’s not really “passion” they are looking for, but people who are merely willing to endure long hours. They aren’t really looking for the person who spends a few hours on the weekend on an open-source project, they are looking for the person who comes home from work and spends all night on it.**

因为他们寻找的不是真正的“激情” ，而是那些仅仅愿意长时间工作的人。 他们并不是真的在寻找那些周末花几个小时在开源项目上的人，他们是在寻找那些下班回家后整晚都在做开源项目的人。

**The good news is I basically already did win the lottery. I built up savings working as a developer which allowed me to quit. I also have a safety net in that if things really go to hell I can live and work on my family’s farm. This is an immense privilege I am grateful for. That savings was originally for a downpayment for a house, but now gives me a landing pad where I can take some time to really do what I love. A few hours of coding, a few hours of writing. I’ve gone from most of my days filled with pain to only a few isolated incidents. Ample time with people I care about. In January I’m starting a [leatherwork vocational program](http://www.chicagoschoolofshoemaking.com/vocational-training/).**

好消息是我基本上已经中了彩票。 作为一名开发人员，我积累了一些储蓄，这使我可以辞职。 我还有一个安全网，如果事情真的变得糟糕，我可以在我家的农场上生活和工作。 这是我感激的一个巨大的特权。 这些存款本来是用来买房子的首付款，但是现在给了我一个登陆平台，我可以花一些时间去做我真正喜欢的事情。 几个小时的编码，几个小时的写作。 我已经从充满痛苦的大部分日子变成了仅有的几个孤立的事件。 有充足的时间和我关心的人在一起。 一月份，我开始了一个皮具职业项目。

**Where do I go from here? That house downpayment money isn’t going to last forever. I’m not delusional in that I know the effect this is having on my career track. That selling USA-made consumer goods is a tough industry. I’ve had lots of dire warnings from various people in my life. If I try to go back, I know a lot of companies will run as soon as they know I have other priorities in my life and I’m not afraid to defend them. But I have a diverse skillset that hopefully will earn me value somehow.**

我该怎么办？ 那幢房子的首付款不会永远持续下去。 我并没有妄想症，因为我知道这对我的职业生涯有什么影响。 销售美国制造的消费品是一个艰难的行业。 在我的生活中，我收到过很多来自不同人群的可怕警告。 如果我试图回到过去，我知道很多公司一旦知道我生活中还有其他优先事项，并且我不怕为它们辩护，就会立即开始运营。 但是我有一套多样化的技能，希望能以某种方式为我赢得价值。

**Of course there are a lot of jobs out there besides software development that involve long, harmful hours. I dream of a world where we all work less. In the meantime I’ll still be here coding, maybe actually enjoying it again, and trying to find a life where I have true balance between my work and my other needs.**

当然，除了软件开发之外，还有很多工作需要长时间的、有害的工作时间。 我梦想着一个我们都少工作的世界。 与此同时，我仍然会在这里编写代码，也许真的会再次享受它，并试图找到一种生活，在我的工作和其他需求之间找到真正的平衡。
